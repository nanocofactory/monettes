MONET CIPHERS:

Monet - B2C scryptoasset as neuromarketing exchange (markex) investment instrument - is virtual hedge representing a hybrid of gift card, bundle, option (finance) and merch.

Monet cipher displays the benefit-to-value scripts underlying the given monet. Scripts are nerves or simplicial sets of benefits of a product as a small category, reduced from partial orders to total orders, i.e. linearized/serialized.

Neurocoins (scryptocurrency, e.g. $GoodMood), value hash tokens, are encrypted as uni- and multi-intersections/overlaps of benefit-to-value scripts (marked with different colors) as nerve (small category's simplicial set) face intersections/corners/coins or nerve filters/filtration members.
