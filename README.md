NEUROCOMPUTATION:

Neurocomputation (distinguished from  neurocomputing) is quantum-perceptual - incl. both measurement-based and adiabatic/unitary - human/social computation that:

1 - computes homomorphisms (in topological benefit spaces of values) rather than functions (in metric feature spaces of products);<br>
2 - carries by corecursion (over simplicial sets/complexes as object assemblages) rather than by recursion (over graphs/networks as object clusters);<br>
3 - is designed and runs as non-well-defined calculation;<br>
4 - is enactive rather than interactive;<br>
5 - is subsymbolic (computing with diagrams) rather than symbolic (computing with words);<br>
6 - uses scripts (noncommutative/permutational) rather than frames (commutative/combinational);
7 - has inquisitive semantics rather than classical semantics;<br>
8 - draws on dynamic ontic logic (onticology) rather than on dynamic epistemic and deontic logics. 

MONETS:

Monet - B2C scryptoasset as neuromarketing exchange (markex) investment instrument (structured commerce product) for monetization - is precommitment virtual hedge instrument representing a hybrid of gift card/certificate/voucher, product bundle, option (finance) and promotional merchandise. They act as buyer decision diffusion channel gain (valorization) proxy media used as ancillas in reversible secure conversion neurocomputation for delayed concurrent consumer choice. Monets are monic (at least over compositions (composable morphisms) of benefit-objects) nets/filters. They are represented with rightward directed diagrams, where unordered horizontal rows stand for causal channels and ordered vertical columns stand for time slots.

MONET CIPHERS:

Monet cipher (cf. code), as topological monet credential, displays the embedding of value scripts (cf. programs and protocols) underlying the given monet. Scripts are nerves or simplicial sets of benefits of a product regarded as a small category, reduced from partial orders to total orders, i.e. linearized/serialized. They generalize the convolutional composed chains of product benefits as signals/stimuli/impulses and respective customer/consumer responses. Fiber bundles/fibrations on these simplicial structures code for and, by homotopy lifting properties, cipher for use value (in excess of exchange value, with surplus value being that positive difference).

NEUROCOINS:

Neurocoin (scryptocurrency, e.g. $GoodMood), i.e. markex token, is encrypted as a single or multiple intersections/overlaps/conjunctions (entanglements) of scripts (path polyominoes marked with different colors) as nerve face intersection/corner/coin or nerve (nerve complex) filter/filtration member. Neurocoins form nerve filter banks/context tree banks. Scripts are in general multi-indexed by one or more indices (index sets; see respective co-labelled polyomino partitions on monet cipher diagrams).
