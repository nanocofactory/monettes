NEUROCOMPUTATION:

Neurocomputation (distinguished from  neurocomputing) is quantum-perceptual - incl. both measurement-based and adiabatic/unitary - human/social computation that:

1 - computes homomorphisms (in topological benefit spaces of values) rather than functions (in metric feature spaces of products);<br>
2 - carries by corecursion (over simplicial sets/complexes as object assemblages) rather than by recursion (over graphs as object networks);<br>
3 - is designed and runs as non-well-defined calculation;<br>
4 - is enactive rather than interactive;<br>
5 - is subsymbolic (computing with diagrams) rather than symbolic (computing with words);<br>
6 - uses scripts (noncommutative/permutational) rather than frames (commutative/combinational);<br>
7 - has inquisitive semantics rather than formal/truth-conditional semantics;<br>
8 - draws on dynamic ontic logic (onticology) rather than on dynamic epistemic and deontic logics. 

MONETS:

Monet (comoney, dual with money) - B2C scryptoasset as neuromarketing exchange (markex) investment instrument (structured commerce product) for monetization - is precommitment virtual hedge instrument representing a hybrid of gift card/certificate/voucher, product bundle, option (finance) and promotional merchandise. They act as proxy media for buyer decision diffusion channel amplification (valorization), used as ancillas in reversible secure conversion neurocomputation for delayed concurrent consumer choice. Monets are monic (at least wrt compositions (composable morphisms/simplices) over benefit-objects) nets/filters used to specify monoid and monoidal networks of complex benefit systems of a product or product bundle. They are represented with rightward directed diagrams, where unordered horizontal rows stand for causal channels and ordered vertical columns stand for time slots.

MONET CIPHERS:

Monet cipher (cf. code), as topological monet credential, displays the value scripts (cf. programs and protocols) underlying and making up the given monet. Values and scripts are compositions/simplices of benefits and of benefit states/objects respectively, and monet cipher is the nerve, i.e. the respective simplicial set of the given product regarded as a small category, reduced from partial orders to total orders, i.e. linearized/serialized. They generalize the convolutional chains of product benefits as signals/stimuli/impulses and respective customer/consumer responses.

Fibrations/cofibrations on these simplicial structures code for and, by homotopy lifting/extension properties, cipher for contextual/experiential/use value (in excess of exchange value, with surplus value being that positive difference): this quantum channel gain is due to hashing transition from classicality/binarity (i.e. payload or deadload) of metric features to nonclassicality of topological benefits, whereby not only payload features but also some deadload features code for benefits by doing that jointly (synchronically) and/or conditionally (diachronically) with payload features and possibly other deadload features.

Scripts (ring ideals) are embedded in monet diagrams as path polyominoes (connected two-dimensional diagram partitions) marked with different colors. Scripts are in general multi-indexed by one or more indices (modes/factors/quotients), such subscripts or scenes/sequels (depending on them being syncing signals/syncopating responses) are rendered in script/path polyominoes as strings (collinear/linearly dependent connected one-dimensional polyomino partitions) labelled with different index (sub)sets.

NEUROCOINS:

Neurocoin (scryptocurrency, e.g. $GoodMood), i.e. quasi-fungible (rotationally fungible) markex (exchangeable use value) token, is encrypted as a single or multiple intersections/overlaps/conjunctions (entanglements) of scripts as nerve face intersection/corner/coin or nerve (nerve complex) filter/filtration member. Neurocoins, of which there are five morphological classes (shapes), form nerve filter banks/context tree banks for ensemble synchronization. A neurocoin's complement comprises respective cofactors.
